        <p>I'm not madly in love with CVs or academic records. I have a BSc, two masters, and a wild-ish job history! If you'd like to know more about that, check me out on  <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/annalisa-iob-a94484a6/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> üòÄ</p>

      <p class="short small">MapAction: 2021 <br />Remote</p>

      <p class="expo">I worked in the sector of humanitarian emergency response for the last three years. Member of a very small Operations Team, I was from the very beginning involved in activities such as <strong>managing web mapping development projects for international organizations; coordinate international training events; plan and organize recruitment &amp; team events.</strong></p>

      <p class="expo">Working in disaster response environments, I am accustomed to fast-paced, high-pressure situations, managing ever-changing priorities, a neverending stock of resourcefulness and creativity, and very high accountability.</p>

     <ul>
	 <li>Organized, coordinated, &amp; participated to 2 on-site training events in the Caribbean, and 6 on-site training events in Central Asia: everything from planning, finding venues and accommodation, organizing travel, &amp; creating the curriculum and material </li></br>

      <h2 class="first">Going Places - Hospitality Industry</h2>

      <p class="expo">I supported my years of studies and travels working as for almost 10 years waitress, barista, receptionist, hostess, breakfast manager, in several different locations and businesses. The experience in Canada was
by far the most life-changing and formative. I moved to Vancouver at the age of 19, with no English, no acquaintances, no help, little money, and in a little over 6 months I was able to create a whole life and social ecosystem for myself.</p>
	<div class="alert">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I come from generations of hospitality experts. My grandad owned a hotel, and I was taught the correct (<i>only</i>, in my family) way to set and clear a table in elementary school.</p>
    </div>
	  
      <p class="expo">Here are some of the incredible businesses I had the pleasure to work with:
	  <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.sciue.ca/" target="_blank">Sciu√©</a>, Vancouver, Canada</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.locanda-sanvigilio.it/" target="_blank">Locanda San Vigilio</a>, Garda Lake, Italy</li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.rifugiovajolet.com/eng/" target="_blank">Vajolet Mountain Hut</a>, Val di  Fassa, Italy</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

      <div class="tldr"><span>Why this matters</span></br> The 10 years in the industry taught me how to: 
	  <ul>
	  <li>Multi-task with a smile </li>
	  <li>Communicate &amp; collaborate with people from all walks of life</li>
	  <li>Always keep a detailed (even the tiniest, most fastidious ones), client-first approach.</li>
	  </div>

      <h2>Let's Talk</h2>

      <p>My hospitality passion and professional expertise, tech-savviness, and coordination experience in very dynamic contexts, molded me into a keen, versatile, and super curious project manager and event coordinator. I am now keen to move towards roles that allow me to move away from the pure, urgent logic of providing the bare minimum, the survival support, and explore more creative endeavors.</p>

      <p>Let's get to know each other! üòÅ</p>
