      <h2 class="first">Going Places - Hospitality Industry</h2>

      <p class="expo">I supported my years of studies and travels working as for almost 10 years waitress, barista, receptionist, hostess, breakfast manager, in several different locations and businesses. The experience in Canada was
by far the most life-changing and formative. I moved to Vancouver at the age of 19, with no English, no acquaintances, no help, little money, and in a little over 6 months I was able to create a whole life and social ecosystem for myself.</p>
	<div class="alert">
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I come from generations of hospitality experts. My grandad owned a hotel, and I was taught the correct (<i>only</i>, in my family) way to set and clear a table in elementary school.</p>
    </div>
	  
      <p class="expo">Here are some of the incredible businesses I had the pleasure to work with:
	  <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.sciue.ca/" target="_blank">SciuÃ©</a>, Vancouver, Canada</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.locanda-sanvigilio.it/" target="_blank">Locanda San Vigilio</a>, Garda Lake, Italy</li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.rifugiovajolet.com/eng/" target="_blank">Vajolet Mountain Hut</a>, Val di  Fassa, Italy</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

      <div class="tldr"><span>Why this matters</span></br> The 10 years in the industry taught me how to: 
	  <ul>
	  <li>Multi-task with a smile </li>
	  <li>Communicate &amp; collaborate with people from all walks of life</li>
	  <li>Always keep a detailed (even the tiniest, most fastidious ones), client-first approach.</li>

      <h2>Let's Talk</h2>

      <p>I was very impressed by the work you do, your mission and values, and your incredibly diverse team. I love the importance you place on partnerships, underpinning an understanding you cannot work in a silo, nor do everything yourself. But most of all, I find inspiring how you center your approach on giving everyone a voice, and design your tools so that they offer an opportunity to listen, and understand.</p>

      <p>What you do and the way you work really resonate with me: I would really love to learn more about your work and projects, let's get to know each other! ðŸ˜€</p>
